## About This Project

This web page was made for the Parents and Children Education Club (PCE Club) for the purpose of organizing the information for virtual events. Features include a description of the organization and event, registration links, and donation options. The following is what the home page should look like:

## How to Make Changes (PCE Club organizers, read this!)

The purpose of this webpage is to allow users to join meetings/donate to the PCE Club in a very straightforward and visually-pleasing manner. For PCE Club leaders who want to update the events page, you can either change the code itself or contact me at [`aliceh4@illinois.edu`](mailto:aliceh4@illinois.edu). The following are instructions to change the code:

- Clone this repository and then open it in a code editor (like Visual Code Studio)
- Navigate to the Events.vue file in the views folder
- Adjust the code accordingly (there are comments in the code with more detailed instructions)
- Check the changes made by running `npm run serve` in the terminal and opening the url in a browser
- Once finished, run 'npm run build`
- Commit and push the repository to GitHub

If these instructions seem too confusing, just send an email to [`aliceh4@illinois.edu`](mailto:aliceh4@illinois.edu) that contains the desired event description and event flyer. The changes will be made as soon as possible.
