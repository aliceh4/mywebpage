## About This Project

This web page was made for the Parents and Children Education Club (PCE Club) for the purpose of organizing the information for virtual events.

## How to Change the Event Page

The purpose of this webpage is to allow users to join meetings/donate to the PCE Club in a very straightforward and visually-pleasing manner. In order to update this page with new PCE events, you can either change the code itself or contact me at [`aliceh4@illinois.edu`](mailto:aliceh4@illinois.edu).
